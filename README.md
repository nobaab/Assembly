# Recursion-In-C

Problem 1:

You will be given an array of integers, write a recursive solution to print it in reverse order.

Input:
5
69 87 45 21 47
Output:
47 21 45 87 69


Problem 2:

Write a recursive function to print an array in the following order.
[0] [n-1]
[1] [n-2]
.........
.........
[(n-1)/2] [n/2]

Input:
5
1 5 7 8 9
Output:
